# â˜• Coffee Machine Simulation

A Python-based command-line simulation of a coffee vending machine. Users can choose from a menu, pay virtually, and receive drinks â€” with real-time resource and money tracking.

## ðŸ§  How It Works

- The machine offers drinks from a preset menu (e.g., espresso, latte, cappuccino).
- It checks whether enough ingredients are available.
- If sufficient, it processes virtual coins using a money machine system.
- After successful payment, it makes the coffee and updates the resources.
